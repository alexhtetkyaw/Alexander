          <div class="body-text">The integration of a Digital Twin for Real-time Assembly Tracking and Physical Making could be highly benifical in the making / creative process. By synchronizing physical fabrication with a digital modeling environment, this innovative system offers a real-time feedback loop, allowing designers and creators to seamlessly bridge the gap between the digital and physical realms. The ability to track and monitor the physical making process in real-time provides invaluable insights into the manufacturing intricacies and potential challenges that may arise during assembly. Real-time simulations provide immediate feedback to designers, enabling them to visualize how their designs manifest in the physical realm. This dynamic feedback loop empowers designers to iterate and adjust designs on the fly for enhanced functionality, structural integrity, and manufacturability.  “A computer ought to give the architect more choice, rather than simply produce an optimum solution” – CoDesigner by Yanni Alexander Loukissas. </div>

          “Design is an iterative process involving ideation, prototyping, and refinement, achieved through reflection-in-action and a trial-and-error approach to understand unique and uncertain situations” - The Reflective Practitioner by Schon.</div>
          <div class="body-text"> While digital tools have granted architects the ability to manage complex task, they are not able to support material engagement and direct sensory information that they physical world provides. 3D modeling software are still bound to 2D graphic user interface and a cartesian design space.
            The potential of a design and fabrication process that facilitates a back-and-forth exchange between the physical and digital models. The project aims to use digital twins to provide an experience that is more akin to traditional design method such as physical model making, where a continuous dialogue exists between the designer and the material.
