          <div class="body-text"> I worked on this in KiCAD. I picked KiCAD instead of the other two since I don't want to pay for fusion after my educational licsence. 
            I was also confused by svg-pcb. There isn't widespread tutorial on this online since it is a new platform. Therefore, as a beginner, I think KiCAD is the best option for me.
